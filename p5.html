         <h5>Reading 3</h5>
		 <p>
		Q1. From the Manovich reading, give 2 examples of a user interface with a piece of technology that has a performative action or theatrical behavior. This is in context with the ideas credited to Brenda Laurel that Lev mentions in the article. IMPORTANT : They can be electronic/digital or analog but NOT a computer, video game console or smart phone. Explain why these are good examples.
             <br> <br>
A toaster could be an example of a user interface that has a performative action or theatrical behavior.  A theatrical behavior would be that “ding” you hear once your food is done toasting.  Toasters have definitely been aestheticized.  If you look at some of the newest models, they are created with touch screens that provide different options for how you want your toast.  There are different categories depending on the type of meal you are making with the machine.  They provide the user with all these new inclusions, making the machine look and sound aesthetic, creating more hype.  Another example of an item would be a clock.  Clocks feature so many different looks today.  There are standard round clocks with all the minute and hour marks.  There are clocks that light up and show the numbers like “12:30.”  There are also very minimalistic clocks that have nothing except the minute and hour hands.  All these clocks have different sounds, color options, lighting options, and little features that make them even more pleasing to the eyes, leading consumers to purchase them. 
             <br> <br>
Q2. Also from the Manovich reading, Lev uses the term Gesamtkunstwerk. What does this term mean and what is he referring to the aestheticization of information tools? <br> <br>
The reading defined it as “directly engaging the three senses of sight, hearing and touch, and evoking the fourth sense of taste through the phone's name and color.”  Basically, this means to The aestheticization of information tools refers to how technology these days are being created to be more efficient as well as aesthetically pleasing.  With technology looking more aesthetic, consumers see these tools as an improvement of the older ones, making them want the newest editions of these.  <br> <br>
Q3. From the RadioLab Podcast, the guest podcast artist is sharing his radio show called 99% invisible. The first piece is about sound design. What would you describe the role of this kind of sound designer and how does it relate to this idea of theatre and performance? <br> <br>
The role of a sound designer like this is to create sounds that we need in life to understand and use our technology.  This relates to the idea of theatre and performance because it is how we know what technologies are being used.  For example, my toaster has a distinct ring when it is done toasting.  That is how I know my food is done.  Same goes for my microwave, airfryer, and rice cooker.  All these sounds are created so we know where it is coming from.  This performance they provide gives us the knowledge we need to accomplish our tasks.  <br> <br>
Q4. From the Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design article, what are the philosophical and visual differences between Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design and how might this also relate to this idea of theatre and gamification or aesthetic based event described in the Lev Article? <br> <br>
The visual differences between Skeuomorphism and Flat Design are that with Skeuomorphism, the visuals are usually more three dimensional, using shading and textures to create this illusion.  Flat design features two dimensional designs in which minimalism is the goal.  There are no shadows making the objects look very flat.  Realism was more of a factor in Skeuomorphism.  Philosophically, flat design has a focus on minimalism and cleanliness.  Skeuomorphism is more focused on recreating familiar objects or shapes.  <br> <br>
  Q5. Based on the Manovich reading, and following up on Q.1 ., As a group, find 3 or more images of different examples of technologies that embodies for you the authors idea of how interfaces to early electronics or machine systems were designed in the past. Specifically look for examples from 1950's,60's, and 70's, (..not 1980's and 90's...). Explain why these are good examples. Then list 2 or more more images of examples of technology that embody the authors ideas of how interfaces are today. Again, explain why these are good examples. Please include images and text description for each example you are refering to. At least 2 images minimum per person from a group. For example a group of 3 should have 6 images. Share these images as a group in discord, and then publish your images on your readings website.

         <h5> Washing machine</h5>
		<p>
		The washing machine is an early example of a machine without performative or theatric function.  This machine is completely analog.  You must handspin the wheel in order for it to work.  There are no special sounds or visuals to let you know that your clothes are clean.  You must decide yourself when it is done washing.

         <h5> Latte machine</h5>
		<p>
		This early latte machine is another example of a machine without performative aspects.  This machine, unlike those of today, has the sole purpose of making a latte without any extra functions.  You hand make your latte.  Latte machines today are automated, and you can hear when the machine is ready to be used and when the machine is making the latte.  This machine, as cumbersome looking as it is, is still simple in its way of making you make your latte by hand.

         <h5> Toaster</h5>
		<p>
		The early toasters do not have all the performative features of today's toasters.  Unlike today's toasters, which have many features, such as ding sounds, touch screens, and elaborate designs, the early toasters were much more simplistic, toasting your bread and popping it up when it was done.  There were far less theatrics compared to the smart toasters we see today.

         <h5> Smart Toaster</h5>
		<p>
		The smart toaster is an example of today's technology that features this concept of performative aspects and theatrics.  The toaster has distinctive dings to alert the user of when the food is done.  There are also visual performative aspects with this specific toaster.  There is a smart touch screen that allows users to pick the kind of bread they are toasting and the color they would prefer it to be.  The screen shows the visual selections with "buttons" to press when making the selection.

         <h5> Smart Plant</h5>
		<p>
		This smart plant features a spider-like robotic planter that walks around looking for sun and shade automatically.  This performative action of walking around further supports the concept of technology with theatrics.  It acts as a little pet, throwing tantrums when it is in need of water.  These behaviors contribute to the performative actions.

   Q6. As a group, please come up with examples of two different kind of technology that normally don't have this interface design or 'consideration' mentioned in the reading and podcast, but could benefit from this 'theatrifaction' or 'gamification' idea of its interface. Please describe what would you suggest doing to it to change it.

      <div class="eight columns">    
         <h5> Smart Home</h5>
		<p>
		The smart home is a newer kind of technology that does not have this type of interface.  It could benefit from theatrification with additions of softwares like "Alexa."  To change this system, a software, like "Alexa," could be created but with a different personality type to comply with the functions of the home.  It may be slightly terrifying if your house in under control of some aware software, but with today's technology, it seems very likely to occur in the near future.

         <h5> Smart Cleaner</h5>
		<p>
		Cleaning supplies could benefit from "gamification."  Smart cleaners, such as iRobots, already exist.  These do feature more performative actions, such as the little tunes they play when they are done and more, but what about other cleaning tools, like mops? Mopping has never been a fun task, but with gamification, it could become something more.  If we gamified it, by adding tasks, or goals on a smart screen, people may become more obliged to clean instead of dreading it.  It could even become a form of exercise.  Cleaning in general could be benefited greatly by gamification.
