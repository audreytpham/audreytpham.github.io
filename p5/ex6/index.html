<h1> Exercise 6 </h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Statement</strong>) For example 6 of my project 3 set, the drawing tool program from
  project 2 is transferred over to p5js.  In order to do this, I first had to go through and change any commands
  that were not the same in p5js.  For example, "void" becomes "function."  There were lots of changes that had to be made,
  so using the inspect function on the browser, I looked for the errors listed and fixed them on the code.  I added an
  additional two brushes, which included a pig and a frog brush.  I used the same frame of using functions with arguments
  to create these.    </p>
