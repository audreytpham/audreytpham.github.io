<h1> Exercise 8 </h1>

<p> For example 8 of my final project set, we were required to include another P5 library and add an additional two scenes.  The library I decided to use was clickable.  This example piece was used as a test run for my main project.  I was able to figure out how to implement the clickable code into my own code and creat buttons that perform actions when pressed.  For my first scene, I designed an underwater environment where a fish can be seen swimming across the screen.  There is a button labeled "Bubbles," which when pressed, begins the animation of bubbles appearing on the screen.  Bubble noises are also played during the scene.  For the last scene, I created a cat image, and when landing on the scene, cat screeches play.  This allowed me to play with the sound libraries and understand how to load them in.   </p>
