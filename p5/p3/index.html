<h1> Project 3 </h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Statement</strong>) For project 3, we had to make a clock that showed the time of something other than a normal clock showing how the day passes.  I created a clock showing the cycle of when my dog needs to used the bathroom.  He goes out to use the bathroom at 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM, 9 PM, and 12 AM, so at those times, a poop illustration pops up for ten seconds.  At 4 PM, the sky changes to a dark purple to represent night time.  This lasts until 7 AM, and the sky becomes blue again.  The different dogs represent different measurements of time.  The bottom represents seconds.  The middle dog represents minutes.  The top dog represents the hours. </p>
